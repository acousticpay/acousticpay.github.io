How AcousticPay works? 
A client having AcousticPay application initiates a mobile payment through their mobile device. Using the  State of the Art technology of AcousticPay, ultrasonic or in-audible data transmission occurs, through, a secure tri-communication among the mobile device, server and POS (Point of Sale) terminal via microphone and speaker. 
Mobile device and POS terminal sends and receives encrypted data between devices. AcousticPay uses UTAB technology, complete throughput of 2,000 bit per second to send and receive encrypted audio data. 
Each audio message has four parts, the Initiator, PublicKey, Header and Payload. 

    • Initiator: The initiator tone announces the presence of an audio tone to start SDK demodulation.
    • Public Key: Audio tone of Public Key.
    • Header: The header contains the metadata regarding the payload.
    • Payload: The main or actual data containing portions of the audio.
